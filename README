   SIWO is a public, personal project that focuses on the creation of an

   Instruction Set Architecture ( ISA ) along with an accompanying parser and

   compiler in order to execute high-level programs. This project aims to

   document all design decisions, pertaining to limitations and optimizations

   found at the hardware and language levels. Most notably, this project will

   attempt to start from a single-cycle processor and eventually implement

   a pipeline design, where further optimizations will be added in order to

   improve the processor's efficiency. All changes will be recorded in both

   this file listed under the change log segment and to the appropriate
   
   sub-project, along with design decisions if any are made.
